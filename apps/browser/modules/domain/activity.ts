 * features are derived downstream.
 *
 * Provenance contract (the Graphiti episode pattern): every event carries a
 * stable unique `id`. Derived facts (slice E) cite the events they were
 * computed from via `sourceEventIds`, and carry a bi-temporal envelope
 * `{ validFrom, validTo?, learnedAt, invalidatedAt? }` — superseded facts are
 * invalidated, never deleted.
