 * ── What left at migration step 5 ───────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `standing`, `armable` and `gates` used to live here. They were a projection of
 * `~/.kairos/keel/rules/*.json`, which was a second declared-rule store beside
 * the `fences` collection, and the extension had to union the two on every
 * actuation. That store is retired: what is in force now arrives once, as the
 * pushed armed record (`modules/interventions/`), and the questions those three
 * answered are asked of it instead — `browserStandingHosts`,
 * `browserArmableHosts`, `armedGatesFor`.
 *
 * What remains is genuinely other: transforms and the break target still come
 * off rules the host projects, and areas, the area map and the moment's
 * allow/deny pair are kernel collections rather than rules at all.
 *
 * Deliberately a *cache*, not a store: nothing here is authoritative, and a
 * stale or empty cache must fail toward the previous state rather than toward
 * unblocked.
